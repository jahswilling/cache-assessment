# Cache Infrastructure

This repository contains the infrastructure code for the Cache application, built using Terraform. The infrastructure is designed to be modular, secure, and scalable, supporting multiple environments (dev, staging, and production).

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure consists of several key components:

- **Network**: Core networking infrastructure including VPC, subnets, and firewall rules
- **GKE**: Google Kubernetes Engine cluster for container orchestration
- **Database**: Managed database services
- **PubSub**: Message queue and event streaming
- **Bastion**: Secure access management
- **Artifact Registry**: Container image storage

## Prerequisites

- Terraform (version >= 1.0.0)
- Google Cloud SDK
- Appropriate Google Cloud permissions
- kubectl (for Kubernetes management)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure your Google Cloud credentials
3. Navigate to the desired environment directory
4. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
5. Review the planned changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
6. Apply the changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Environment Management

Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own configuration and state. This allows for:
- Independent deployment and management
- Environment-specific resource configurations
- Isolated testing and validation

## Security Considerations

- All environments use secure networking configurations
- Bastion host provides controlled access to resources
- IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
- Sensitive data is managed through secure methods

## Contributing

1. Create a new branch for your changes
2. Make your modifications
3. Test the changes in a development environment
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks include:
- Updating module versions
- Reviewing and updating security configurations
- Monitoring resource usage
- Applying security patches
