# Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the implemented infrastructure components for the Cache application, built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Infrastructure (Cache-infrastructure)
- **Terraform Modules**
  - Network: VPC and subnet configuration
  - GKE: Private cluster setup
  - Database: PostgreSQL configuration
  - Pub/Sub: Topic and subscription setup
  - IAM: Service accounts and roles
  - External Secrets: Integration with GCP Secret Manager
  - Bastion: Secure access point
  - Artifact Registry: Container image storage

### 2. Application (cache_app_demo)
- **Dockerized Django Application**
  - Container configuration with Dockerfile
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - API endpoints including health check
  - Integration with:
    - PostgreSQL database
    - Pub/Sub messaging
  - Requirements and dependencies management
  - Production Access: http://34.169.247.6/

### 3. Kubernetes Configuration (k8s)
- **Deployment Resources**
  - Deployment configuration for application pods
  - Service definition for internal/external access
  - Load Balancer IP: 34.169.247.6
  - ConfigMap for environment variables
  - External Secrets integration
  - Database migration job
  - Namespace configuration

### 4. CI/CD Implementation
- **GitHub Actions**
  - Automated build and test pipeline
  - Container image building and pushing
  - Deployment to GKE cluster
  - Secret management integration

## Security Implementation

### Access Control
- Private GKE cluster with bastion access
- IAM roles and service accounts
- External secrets for sensitive data
- Load Balancer access control

### Secret Management
- GCP Secret Manager integration
- External Secrets Operator in Kubernetes
- Secure credential storage and retrieval

## Current Status

### Working Components
- Infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
- Application containerization
- Kubernetes deployment configuration
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Secret management system
- Database and Pub/Sub integration
- Load Balancer accessible at http://34.169.247.6/

### Known Limitations
- Private cluster access requires bastion
- Deployment automation needs improvement
- Argo CD integration pending

## Next Steps
1. Implement Argo CD for GitOps
2. Enhance deployment automation
3. Improve monitoring and logging
4. Add automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Access Control Matrix

| Resource Type | Access Level | Authentication Method | Authorization Scope |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| GKE Cluster  | Admin        | Bastion + kubectl    | Cluster-admin       |
| GKE Cluster  | Developer    | Bastion + kubectl    | Namespace-specific  |
| Cloud SQL    | Application  | Service Account      | Database access     |
| Pub/Sub      | Application  | Service Account      | Topic operations    |
| Secret Manager | CI/CD     | Service Account      | Read-only access    |
| Load Balancer | Public      | HTTP/HTTPS          | Application access  |

## Security Controls
